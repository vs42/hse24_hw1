Bismark report for: SRR5836473_1.fq and SRR5836473_2.fq (version: v0.24.2)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /mnt/cache-1/for_minor/mm39_11/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	105128431
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	2858170
Mapping efficiency:	2.7% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	99105404
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	3164857
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
