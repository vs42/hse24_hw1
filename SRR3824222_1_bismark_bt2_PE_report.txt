Bismark report for: SRR3824222_1.fq and SRR3824222_2.fq (version: v0.24.2)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /mnt/cache-1/for_minor/mm39_11/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	163155973
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	7051731
Mapping efficiency:	4.3% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	151720997
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	4383245
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
